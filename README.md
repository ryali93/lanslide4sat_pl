# [Landslide4Sat PL]: Assessment of Semantic Segmentation Models for Landslide Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery in Peruvian Andes

This repository is associated with the paper "Assessment of Semantic Segmentation Models for Landslide Monitoring Using Satellite Imagery in Peruvian Andes" and includes datasets, models, and scripts utilized in the study.

### Dataset Extension
The L4S-PE dataset has been expanded with local Peruvian scenarios, totaling 838 annotated images for a comprehensive analysis of landslides in the region.

### Semantic Segmentation Models
Our experiments with U-net architecture and specialized loss functions have set a new benchmark in performance for landslide detection, achieving a formidable F1-Score of 75.5%.

### Cloud-based Monitoring Framework
We have developed a cloud-based monitoring system leveraging Google Earth Engine, designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of landslide detection and monitoring.
